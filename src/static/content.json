The goal was to solidify TD’s position as the student bank of choice and continue to build a reputation grounded in trust and reciprocity. Initially, this problem statement was presented to a senior class of business analysts students at Wilfrid Laurier University by TD Bank. They uncovered some key findings from focus groups.",

Initially, I had the idea to create an app that would help allow students to connect to and match with scholarship opportunities in order to better help students finance their education. This idea later involved to an application that would help students budget their associated costs and contribution for university. However, the problem became, how could I incentive users to download and use this app, when in reality, most people would only go this process once. I realized that this idea would prove to be better suited for a website and began looking into current budget calculators.",

For example, there was a field for tuition in months, this and other expenses added difficulties to the user’s experience. This calculator was the exact opposite of a beneficial tool and I became inspired to better design a product that was less intimidating, more efficient, and added value to the user’s experience. ",

Since the initial problem statement was so broad, I further narrowed down the problem statement.",

        "text": "The next key step was to identify what key information should be included in the calculator. This was extremely important, as I had to filter out what information what information would matter most to a student, and what was the best way of obtaining this knowledge. For example, most students wouldn’t know the exact cost of their tuition, but they would know their program and course load. Yet, knowing their tuition is still something the calculator needs to calculate their overall cost of education, and therefore, by asking for a user’s school, program and number of courses, we can calculate their tuition for them. In order to correctly gather this information, I reviewed the user interviews I conducted, as well as discussed the information with my fellow peers in order to gain feedback. ",

I also included a summary page after all of the costs to give the user a break from the input fields and act as an overview of their progress so far.",

With my partner, we discussed various ways to add value to the experience and make it easier for a student to go through the process. We realized that high school students don’t typically have much knowledge about numerous expenses, including textbooks, groceries and renting. I came up with the solution to include both type forms and buttons in our experience, with the buttons acting as suggestions for the user. This would aid users by increasing both the financial accuracy of the calculator, and the student tailored experience. I designed several wireframes and then reviewed them with others to gather feedback. I learned that users were more interested in the designs with the larger buttons, and that had a combination of both buttons and type fields.",

AsTD Lab’s goal is to provide an unrestricted environment for students to ideate, this meant that I was allowed to, and actually encouraged to break away from the standard TD green branding. However, when I reflected back on the problem statement and the overall goal of building TD’s brand trust in students I realized that the product should closely follow TD’s brand guidelines, but with a youthful and noninstitutionalized rebrand. In order to build TD’s relationship with students, the product should take the existing bank image, one with a very mature connotation and transition it into something students would find more visually appealing. I decided to keep green as the primary colour and a variety of very bold colours for the category elements that contribute to the bar.",

This would be an opportunity for us to travel to Toronto and TD Towers to present our product to a room of executives. I felt honoured to receive such an opportunity and devoted the next month to revamping the designs. The designs I had created from the hackathon provided me with a very solid base for the next stage of revision. I asked fellow colleagues and interns to comment and critique my designs one by one as I presented my content to them. I received very critical feedback as to both the visual design of the calculator, and the user’s journey.",

I asked questions about their relationship to coffee to find out what entices them and what they would like to see. I collected a lot of use data especially regarding the layout of the platform that I applied later on. I then began figuring out the customer journey for purchasing beans from a roaster. After the initial empathy and observation research, I reviewed the pain points to discover opportunities to improve the user experience and to better define the problem statement. I especially focused on the user thoughts, and was driven by the user personas and focused on having a highly user attitude.
